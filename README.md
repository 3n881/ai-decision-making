AI Decision-Making Model
This repository provides an AI Decision-Making Model built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Flask. The model classifies user input (text-based questions) into predefined categories: Yes, No, or Maybe.

Project Overview
This AI model takes text-based input (such as questions or queries) and classifies them into three categories:

Yes
No
Maybe
The model is trained using Scikit-learn's Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, and the application is served using Flask for easy integration with other applications via a REST API.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.x or higher
pip for managing Python packages
Git (for cloning the repository)
Heroku CLI (optional, for deployment)
You can verify the installation of these dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
python --version
pip --version
git --version
heroku --version  # Optional for Heroku deployment
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and use the AI Decision-Making Model.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/3n881/ai-decision-making.git
cd ai-decision-making
Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies from other Python projects.

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Once you’ve activated the virtual environment, install the necessary dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all required packages such as Flask, Scikit-learn, pandas, and joblib.

Step 4: Train the Model
After installing the dependencies, you can train the model using the provided train_model.py script. This script uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm from Scikit-learn to train the model based on the dataset.

To train the model, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This will:

Load the dataset (dataset.csv).
Preprocess the text data.
Train the Naive Bayes model on the data.
Save the trained model (model.pkl) and vectorizer (vectorizer.pkl) for later use.
You can update or extend the dataset in dataset.csv as needed.

Step 5: Run the Application Locally
To run the Flask API locally, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The application will be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default.

API Usage
After setting up the project and running the application, you can start interacting with the AI model via the REST API.

Test the API
To test the API locally, you can use tools like Postman or cURL to send requests.

API Endpoint:
URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
Method: POST
Request Body (Example):
json
Copy code
{
  "input": "Should I buy a new phone?"
}
How to Call the API
You can send a POST request to the /predict endpoint with a JSON body containing the user input (a question or query). The model will respond with a classification decision.

Example cURL Request:
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": "Should I buy a new phone?"}'
Example Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "decision": "Maybe"
}
Deployment
You can deploy the application on Heroku for remote hosting and accessibility.

Deploy on Heroku
Follow these steps to deploy the app on Heroku:

Create a Heroku Account: If you don’t already have a Heroku account, sign up at Heroku Signup.

Install the Heroku CLI: Follow the instructions for your platform to install the Heroku CLI from Heroku CLI Installation.

Log in to Heroku:

bash
Copy code
heroku login
Create a New Heroku App:

bash
Copy code
heroku create your-app-name
Deploy the Application to Heroku:

bash
Copy code
git push heroku master
Open the Deployed Application:

bash
Copy code
heroku open
Your app should now be live and accessible via the Heroku-provided URL.

Conclusion
This AI Decision-Making Model is designed for developers to quickly integrate and extend for their own use cases. The model classifies text-based input into Yes, No, and Maybe categories. You can expand the model, retrain it with new data, and deploy it to production on platforms like Heroku.
